    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = 100;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // this will print 200, 100

    let name = 'yish';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'yishlee';
    console.log(name, name2); // this will print yishlee, yish

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    console.log(players[2]); // this will print Ryan

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[2] = 'Emily';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players[2]); // this will mutate the original array

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team[2] = 'hello'
    console.log(team)
    console.log(team2)
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.name = 'yishbb';
    console.log(person.name); // this has changed the value in the original reference

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age : 12});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    cap3 = {...person};
    
    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social : {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes) // this does not copy the object deeply
  
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; // this will modify the original as well
    console.log(dev.social.twitter);
    console.log(wes.social.twitter);

    // One way to clone deeply
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@hello';
    console.log(dev2.social.twitter);
    console.log(wes.social.twitter);
